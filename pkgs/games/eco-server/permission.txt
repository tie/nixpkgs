> tie: Does SLG have any policy for packaging the server in Linux distributions?
> Would it be OK to package binary builds of EcoServerLinux in Nixpkgs?

> build from source in Nixpkgs are built), and a wrapper program Iâ€™ve described
> above to write data to the current working directory.

> Dennis: Yes, that is going to be fixed.
> Dennis: For server admins we always recommend to use SteamCMD.
> Dennis: I'm not a devops guy (anymore, at least here), so I can't tell you why
> we did that exactly. I just know we locked the links to a session token on
> web, as for one reason many hosts abused our traffic line to update their
> servers in the past and as we had DoS issues with Amazon. Of what type is
> beyond me, as I'm not involved in the specifics.
> Dennis: But yes, Amazon bills tend to be surprisingly big even for indie as
> us, so getting that back in check is likely going to happen.
> Dennis: Steam anonymous isn't a problem, as that doesn't cost us money ğŸ˜„
